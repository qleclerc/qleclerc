I'm always looking for opportunities to share my work and see what others are doing in my research fields - here's a map of where I've been so far, and where I'll be going.

If you're interested in what I presented at these conferences, please feel free to [contact me](/#contact) !

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(openxlsx)
token <- "pk.eyJ1IjoicWxlY2xlcmMiLCJhIjoiY2sya2I4OHh3MWY3OTNnbnRyb2Rlems1ZiJ9.Vkoa91O2OR7hbt7rsT9kyA"    # You need your own token

conf_data = read.xlsx("conf_data.xlsx")

p <- conf_data %>%
  plot_ly(
    lat = ~lat,
    lon = ~lon,
    marker = list(size = 10),
    color = ~Status,
    colors = c("purple3", "royalblue3"),
    type = 'scattermapbox',
    hoverinfo = "text",
    hovertext = paste(conf_data[,"City"], conf_data[,"Conf"], conf_data[,"Date"], sep="\n")) %>%
  layout(
    mapbox = list(
      style = 'dark',
      accesstoken = token,
      zoom = 2,
      center = list(lat = mean(conf_data$lat), lon = mean(conf_data$lon))),
    legend = list(x = 100, y = 0.5,
                  font = list(
                    size = 14,
                    color = "#000"),
                  bgcolor = "#E2E2E2",
                  bordercolor = "#FFFFFF",
                  borderwidth = 2))

# Create a shareable link to your chart
# Set up API credentials: https://plot.ly/r/getting-started
chart_link = api_create(p, filename="dark-tile")
chart_link
```
