Personal experience
Seems like mostly ECRs talk about this, then it's not really mentionned - perhaps just widely accepted as part of the job? Still interesting to discuss because not necessarily explicitly told, and when student we only supposed to focus on one research project at a time
Guilt about what doing, should be only working on current work? But need to finish before? What time spent doing each?
