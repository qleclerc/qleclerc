Hello! I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institut Pasteur](https://www.pasteur.fr/) and the [CNAM](https://www.cnam.fr/) in Paris, France. I focus on the impact of vaccines against antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I am employed as part of the European project [PrIMAVeRa](https://www.primavera-amr.eu/). For more information on what I do, please refer to my [Projects](/projects/) page.

When I'm not staring at code on my computer screen, I'm a climber, video game enthusiast and movie amateur.
