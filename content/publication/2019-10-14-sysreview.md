abstract: "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the greatest public health challenges we are currently facing. To develop effective interventions against this, it is essential to understand the processes behind the spread of AMR. These are partly dependent on the dynamics of horizontal transfer of resistance genes between bacteria, which can occur by conjugation (direct contact), transformation (uptake from the environment) or transduction (mediated by bacteriophages). Mathematical modelling is a powerful tool to investigate the dynamics of AMR; however, the extent of its use to study the horizontal transfer of AMR genes is currently unclear. In this systematic review, we searched for mathematical modelling studies that focused on horizontal transfer of AMR genes. We compared their aims and methods using a list of predetermined criteria and used our results to assess the current state of this research field. Of the 43 studies we identified, most focused on the transfer of single genes by conjugation in Escherichia coli in culture and its impact on the bacterial evolutionary dynamics. Our findings highlight the existence of an important research gap in the dynamics of transformation and transduction and the overall public health implications of horizontal transfer of AMR genes. To further develop this field and improve our ability to control AMR, it is essential that we clarify the structural complexity required to study the dynamics of horizontal gene transfer, which will require cooperation between microbiologists and modellers."
