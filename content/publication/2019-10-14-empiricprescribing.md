abstract: "**Background:** Antibiotics are most often prescribed empirically, meaning that they are used to treat infection syndromes prior to identification of the causative bacteria and their susceptibility to antibiotics. The effectiveness of antibiotic therapies is now compromised by the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Guidelines on empiric antibiotic therapy are a key component of effective clinical care for infection syndromes, as treatment needs to be informed by knowledge of likely aetiology and bacterial resistance patterns.

\n**Methods:** We used open-access antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance datasets, including the newly available ATLAS dataset from Pfizer, to derive a composite index of antibiotic resistance for common infection syndromes.

\n**Results:** We developed a framework that integrated data on antibiotic prescribing guidelines, aetiology of infections, access to and cost of antibiotics, with antibiotic susceptibilities from global AMR surveillance datasets to create an empirical prescribing index. The results are presented in an interactive web app to allow users to visualise underlying resistance rates to first-line empiric antibiotics for their infection syndromes and countries of interest.

\n**Conclusions:** We found that whilst an index for empiric antibiotic therapy based on resistance data can technically be created, the ATLAS dataset in its current form can only inform on a limited number of infection syndromes. Other open-access AMR surveillance datasets (ECDC Surveillance Atlas, CDDEP ResistanceMap and WHO GLASS datasets) are largely limited to bacteraemia-derived specimens and cannot directly inform treatment of other infection syndromes. With improving data availability on international rates of AMR and better understanding of infection aetiology, our approach may prove useful for informing empiric prescribing decisions in settings with limited local AMR surveillance data. Syndrome-level resistance could be a more clinically relevant measure of resistance to inform on the appropriateness of empiric antibiotic therapies at the country-level."
